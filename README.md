# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
I completed this project **after the first week** at Istanbul Data Science Academy.

### Datasets are transferred from the websites below:
* Trends in Atmosphered CO2 - https://datahub.io/core/co2-ppm
  > Data is sourced from the US Governmentâ€™s Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division. 
  Used The Mauna Loa series (which has the longest continuous series since 1958)
* CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels since 1751, By Nation - https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-by-nation
  > Data comes from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC).
